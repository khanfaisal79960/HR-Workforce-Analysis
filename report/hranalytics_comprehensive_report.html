    <h1>HR Workforce Analysis Report</h1>
    <p>Comprehensive analysis of Workforce Dynamics</p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 24, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Prepared by:</strong> Khan Faisal</p>

        <h1>HR Attrition Analytics Report</h1>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 25, 2025</p>

        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This report provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition within the organization, leveraging the HR Analytics dataset. The primary goal is to identify key drivers of attrition, understand underlying patterns, and propose actionable strategies for retention. Our findings indicate that attrition is significantly influenced by factors such as lower monthly income, shorter tenure, specific job roles and education fields, and demographic attributes like age, gender, and marital status. Notably, even employees reporting high job satisfaction are attriting, suggesting a need for a holistic review of employee experience beyond satisfaction scores.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Income & Tenure:** The "Upto $5,000" monthly income group and employees with shorter tenure experience the highest attrition rates.</li>
            <li>**Demographics:** Younger employees (late 20s to early 30s), male employees, and single employees show higher propensity for attrition.</li>
            <li>**Role & Education:** Research Scientists, Laboratory Technicians, Manufacturing Directors, and individuals from Life Sciences and Medical education backgrounds have elevated attrition figures.</li>
            <li>**Job Satisfaction Paradox:** A significant number of attritions occur even among employees with "High" job satisfaction, indicating that satisfaction alone is not a complete predictor of retention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement targeted compensation reviews and enhanced early-career development programs.</li>
            <li>Develop specific retention strategies for high-attrition roles and education fields.</li>
            <li>Conduct deeper qualitative research into gender-specific and marital status-related attrition factors.</li>
            <li>Investigate non-satisfaction drivers of attrition to create a more comprehensive employee experience strategy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>Objective of the Report</h3>
        <p>
            The objective of this report is to conduct an in-depth analysis of employee attrition using the provided HR dataset.

            Employee attrition poses significant challenges to organizations, including increased recruitment costs, loss of institutional knowledge, and potential impacts on team morale and productivity. Understanding the root causes of why employees leave is crucial for proactive HR management. This report serves as a foundational step in building a robust HR analytics capability focused on talent retention.

        <h2>Recommendation & Insights</h2>
        <p>This section details the findings from each analysis and provides specific insights and actionable recommendations.</p>

        <h3>1. Attrition Analysis by Education Field</h3>
        <div class="section-data">
            <h4>Findings:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>**Life Sciences:** 46.3%</li>
                <li>**Medical:** 37.4%</li>
                <li>**Technical Degree:** 9.7%</li>
                <li>**Other:** 6.6%</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Employees from 'Life Sciences' and 'Medical' education fields collectively represent a significant majority of all attritions. This indicates that these education backgrounds might be experiencing higher turnover, potentially due to external market demand or internal challenges.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Investigate market competitiveness for these fields and assess internal growth opportunities or specific challenges faced by employees with these backgrounds.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. Attrition Analysis by Gender</h3>
        <div class="section-data">
            <h4>Findings:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>**Male Attrition:** 240 employees</li>
                <li>**Female Attrition:** 153 employees</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Male employees account for a significantly higher number of attritions (240) compared to female employees (153). This disparity warrants further investigation.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Conduct qualitative research (e.g., exit interviews, focus groups) to understand gender-specific factors contributing to attrition, such as career progression, work-life balance, or management support.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>3. Attrition Analysis by Monthly Income Group</h3>
        <div class="section-data">
            <h4>Findings:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>**Upto 5k:** 274 attritions</li>
                <li>**5k-10k:** 94 attritions</li>
                <li>**10k-15k:** 21 attritions</li>
                <li>**15k+:** 4 attritions</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Insight:</strong> The "Upto 5k" monthly income group experiences the highest number of attritions by a significant margin. Attrition rates sharply decline as monthly income increases, strongly suggesting that lower compensation is a major factor in employee turnover.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Prioritize a review of compensation structures for lower-income brackets to ensure competitive pay and reduce financial pressure as a driver of attrition.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>4. Attrition Analysis by Age</h3>
        <div class="section-data">
            <h4>Findings:</h4>
            <p>Attrition is most concentrated in certain age groups. The highest numbers of attritions are observed around:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Age 35:** 52 attritions</li>
                <li>**Age 34:** (approx 48-50 attritions)</li>
                <li>**Age 29:** (approx 45 attritions)</li>
                <li>**Age 31:** (approx 42 attritions)</li>
                <li>**Age 32:** (approx 40 attritions)</li>
                <li>**Age 30:** (approx 38 attritions)</li>
                <li>**Age 33:** (approx 36 attritions)</li>
                <li>**Age 27:** (approx 35 attritions)</li>
                <li>**Age 28:** (approx 32 attritions)</li>
                <li>**Age 26:** (approx 26 attritions)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Attrition generally shows a decreasing trend with increasing age, with very few attritions occurring in employees above 45 years old.</p>
            <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Employees in their mid-30s and late 20s are more prone to attrition. This demographic might be more mobile in the job market, seeking rapid career progression, or experiencing different work-life priorities not adequately addressed by the organization.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Implement robust career development programs, mentorship opportunities, and flexible work arrangements tailored to the needs and aspirations of younger talent.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>5. Attrition Analysis by Job Role</h3>
        <div class="section-data">
            <h4>Findings:</h4>
            <ul>

                <li>**Manager:** 6 attritions</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Insight:</strong> 'Research Scientists', 'Laboratory Technicians', and 'Manufacturing Directors' are the job roles with the highest number of attritions. These roles may face unique challenges, high market demand, or specific stressors.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Develop targeted retention strategies for these high-attrition roles, including specialized training, clear career paths, workload management, and competitive compensation reviews specific to these functions.</p>
        </div>
